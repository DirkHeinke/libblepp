Haskell Notation
----------------

I've used Haskell style notation. Functions, dictionaries and arrays are
essentially similar in that both map an input to an output, i.e. A -> B.
Tuples are indicated with "," and "()". Returned lists or arrays with [].
Alternatives are indicated with |. For arguments, The type is written first, and
the name (if applicable) follows after a  "." .


Attribute Protocol: A high level view
-------------------------------------

The ATT protocol allows you to read data off the bluetooth device.

Attributes are read by handle. Data is arranged as an array indexed by handle,
or equivalently a function of Handle->Data. Not every element is indexable, so
it's more like:

read:  Handle -> Data | Null

Each attribute also has Information, which consists of a Type (stored as a
UUID). Formally:

find_information: [ (Handle, Type) ]


Using a combination of find_information and read_attribute, one could create the
list [ (Handle, Type, Data) ] for all attributes. It is simple to find all
data elements matching a certain type. To prevent excessive reading, a function
is provided which reads all data of a given type:

read_by_type: Type -> [(Handle, Data)]

NB: types are generally rather high level things. "string" is not a type,
"device name" would be a type. I believe that all data elements sharing a type
must have the same length. A "Type" is more of a name.

Closely related to read_by_type is the function read_group_by_type. Not only do
attributes have a type, but an entire group can be of a certain type:

read_group_by_type: Type -> [( Handle, Handle, Type ) ]

The returned value is the first handle in the group, the second is one past the
last handle, and the Type is the type of that particular element of the group,
not the type of the group itself.


Actually reading data
---------------------

In practice each query can only be answered with a very limited amount of data.
Note that each of the functions above (except read) returns a list of handles.
In the protocol, each function actually takes a start and end handle as an
argument which limits which handles will be returned. In order to get a complete
list of things, one must keep setting the start handle to one plus the last
handle returned and reissuing the call. When no handles can be returned an error
message is sent back, indicating that no handles exist in the range.

The read_by_type function is actually more like:

read_by_type: (Type, Handle.first, Handle.last) -> [ (Handle, Data) ] | Error.no_attribute_in_range




The Generic Attribute Profile 
-----------------------------

The generic attribute (GATT) profile defines a standard set of attributes,
along with mechanisms for discovery.

A GATT profile consists of a number of services. A service defines a set of
"characteristics". A characteristic is is some kind of readable or writable
property, and information about that.

Primary services are groups of handles which have the name <<Primary Service>>
aka 0x2900. Therefore 
	read_group_by_type(0x2900) 
returns the list of services.  Any handle falling in the the group belongs to
the service named by that group.  The names are either ones specified by the SIG
or custom ones. 

The list of characteristics can be read by reading type <<Characteristic>> aka 2803.
	read_by_type 0x2803
The return from this is for each characteristic:

<Property> <Handle> <Type>

Property is a bit field indicating various properties, things like readable,
writable, notifyable, and so on.

Two services must always be present: <<Generic Access>> (aka 1800) and <<Generic
Attribute>> (aka 1801)


If a characteristic value is readable, it is indicated by the property. Also,
the value will have handle <Handle> and type <Type>. It can be read by reading
the handle or reading by it's type. In other words <Handle> and <Type> are
(nearly?) tautological.
